There are many stresses that come with running a startup company, but when you don't have millions of dollars of <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/other-people-s-money-OPM.html" target="_blank">OPM</a> at your disposal, the primary worry is about revenue: 

<i>Will we close that deal?</i> 
<i>Will our sales numbers improve?</i>
<i>How do we attract more clients?</i>

et. cetera

It can lead to destructive short-term thinking and frustration. Worst of all, it can make you start to hate the things you liked about tech startups in the first place: programming, the joy of creating new things, and the belief that what you're doing can change the world.

I don't make New Year Resolutions usually, but this year, I've been inspired by this passage from <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character/oclc/10925248" target="_blank">"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!" Adventures of a Curious Character</a>, the autobiography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>. 

Feynman is a young professor at Cornell, and he describes the career burnout he was feeling at the time, as well as how he got out of the funk.

Replace "physics" with "startup" and he could be describing me:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/naL0X.png" border="0" alt="quote" align="left" style="padding-right: 4px;" /> Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to <em>enjoy</em> doing physics. Why  did I enjoy it? I  used to <em>play</em> with it. I used to do whatever I felt  like doing -- it didn't have to do  with whether it was important  for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to  play with. When I was in high school, I'd see water running out of a  faucet growing narrower,  and  wonder if I could figure  out what determines that curve. I  found it was rather easy to do. I didn't  <em>have</em> to do it; it  wasn't important  for  the  future  of  science; somebody  else had  already  done it.  That didn't make any  difference: I'd invent things and play with things for my own entertainment.

So  I got this  new  attitude. Now that  I <em>am</em> burned out and I'll never accomplish  anything, I've got this nice position at the university teaching classes which I  rather enjoy, and just  like I  read the <em>Arabian Nights</em> for pleasure,  I'm  going to  <em>play</em> with physics,  whenever  I want to,  without worrying about any importance whatsoever.

Within  a week  I was in  the cafeteria and  some guy,  fooling around, throws a plate  in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty  obvious  to  me that the  medallion  went  around  faster  than  the wobbling.

I  had  nothing to do, so  I  start  to figure out  the  motion  of the rotating plate. I discover that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast  as the wobble rate  -- two to  one. It came  out of a complicated equation! Then I thought, "Is there some way I can see in a more fundamental way, by looking at the  forces or the dynamics, why it's two  to one?"

I  don't remember  how I did  it, but I ultimately worked  out what the motion of  the mass particles is, and how all the  accelerations balance  to make it come out two to one.

I still  remember going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe" target="_blank">Hans Bethe</a> and saying, "Hey, Hans! I noticed something  interesting. Here the plate goes  around so, and  the reason it's two to one is..." and I showed him the accelerations.

He says, "Feynman, that's pretty interesting, but what's the importance of it? Why are you doing it?"

"Hah!" I say. "There's no importance whatsoever.  I'm just doing it for the fun of it."  His reaction didn't discourage me; I had made up my mind  I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked.

I went on to  work out  equations of wobbles.  Then I thought about how electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac Equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics.  And  before I knew it (it  was a very  short time) I was "playing" --  working, really -- with the same  old problem that I loved so much, that I had stopped working on when I went  to Los  Alamos:  my  thesis-type problems;  all  those  old-fashioned, wonderful things.

It was effortless.  It was easy to play with these things. It  was like uncorking  a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly.  I almost  tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html" target="_blank">the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for</a> came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/WCAvh.png" border="0" alt="quote" align="right" style="padding-left: 4px;" />
